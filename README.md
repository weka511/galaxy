Implementation of the [Barnes Hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation) algorithm
to simulate the evolution of a galaxy. This code has been compiled under [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

## Acknowledgements

|  Date | Remarks |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|31&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;18| Program segfaults. Turn off Barnes-Hut and try some easy test cases, e.g. Kepler, Lagrange points, and a resonance |
| 4 Feb 18| Traced problem to acceleration calcs: when we figure out force on a particular particle we included the particle itself. This has been corrected, but [the fix is a kludge, so some work still needs to be done](https://github.com/weka511/galaxy/issues/2).<br>_Particles are diverging,_ is the initial velocity too high?|
| 6 Feb 18 | Reset centre of mass and linear momentum to (0,0,0) at start of run, and checked code. Configuration still d rifts. Need to construct simplest possible case that exhibits error. | 
| 7 Feb 18 | I have done some more checking by adding tracing statements, and code appears to be working, albeit with large error. I am studying [ Error analysis of a tree code by Barnes and Hut.](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1989ApJS...70..389B) Do errors decrease for very many particles? What if we soften gravitational potential? Another thought: what is error in Geneva code?|
| 8 Feb 18 | Downloaded Geneva version and modified to display energy. At present this does not appear to be conserved |
|13&nbsp;Feb&nbsp;18| I am logging parameters, so can now investigate dependence of energy anomaly on dt, softening, and theta. I'm also doing some long runs to study long-term behaviour.|
|26 Feb 18| The kinetic energy and potential energy aren't following Virial theorem very well. I will check mass distribution first.|
|17&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;18| After a week of development I now have a multithreaded version. I don't think I'd have started if I'd realized how much work it was. Just doing a few time comparisons. Later: very disappointing - multi-threaded is slower than single threaded.| 
|18 Mar 18|What if there many more than 1000 bodies? We possibly need the acceleration calculation to be much longer to see the benefit of threads? No: I have just tested, with 100000 bodies, 10 iterations. 4 threads, 448 seconds; 2 threads, 448; unthreaded, 165|
|&nbsp;| I have created a factory to allow more complex simulations, e.g. colliding galaxies. I decided to use XML rather than CSV, and used [Lee Thomason's TinyXML-2](http://leethomason.github.io/tinyxml2/index.html), following the discussion [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/170686/what-is-the-best-open-xml-parser-for-c). XML is more than I require at present, but I expect the complexity of the input files weill increase, so this is by way of future proofing.|
|25 Mar 18|I'm curious to see whether the configuration eventually becomes thermalized--see [Debarshee Bagchi and Constantino Tsallis: Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou problems: Passage from Boltzmann to qq-statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08729). Since we were throwing away the momentum when we write the configuration, I've raised [Issue #32](https://github.com/weka511/galaxy/issues/32) to fix this. This is also a good time to simplify the code by removing energy calcs, so we use c++ for heavy lifting, but do as much as possible in Python.|
| 26 Mar 18|This shows the distribution after 5400 iterations, compared with the Bolzmann Distribution. ![Alt text](energy05400.png?raw=true "Title") Here is version from earlier in the simulation, which is not very Boltzmann.![Alt text](energy00200.png?raw=true "Title")This shows the evolution of the beta parameter. ![Alt text](boltzmann.png?raw=true "Title") |
| 2 Apr 18 | Revisit Virial Theorem - what is the effect of the softening length? |
